\section{Introduction}
%
Over the last decade, mobile offloading techniques have emerged as
intelligent means to overcome the constraints of the limited resources
from mobile platforms, smartphones and tabletPCs, so that these types of
devices delegate computationally intensive computing tasks to more
powerful external resources such as personal workstations or cloud
servers.
%
Initially, most of research interests on mobile offloading techniques
have focused on core mechanisms in which \textit{what to offload} and
\textit{how to offload} have been primarily considered. 
%
The research community has studied various approaches to implement mobile
offloading frameworks which fall in the following categories:
application partitioning~\cite{spectra, maui, cuckoo}, thread
migration~\cite{clonecloud, comet}, application migration~\cite{hung},
and distributed offloading frameworks~\cite{mmr, serendipity}.\\
%
\indent However, one important fact from an offloading performance
standpoint of view is that benefits from offloading
computation-intensive portions of mobile applications can be influenced
by various internal and external factors such as application
requirements, network conditions, and computing capabilities of mobile
or external devices.
%
Thus, \textit{whether to offload or execute locally} needs to be
decided periodically by monitoring aforementioned dynamic features on
runtime.
%
Otherwise, incorrect offloading decisions may cause the performance
degradation or worse energy consumption.
%
For that reason, research focuses have been naturally shifted into
dynamic scheduling or decision making problems for mobile offloading
framework.
%
For example, Kwon et al.~\cite{kwon} consider a simple rule-based
scheduler in which the framework decides to offload the mobile
computation only when the data transfer size is higher than a certain
threshold.
%
MAUI~\cite{maui} utilizes a linear regression model among predefined
features to make offloading decisions.\\
%
\indent Even though these studies on the runtime scheduler for mobile
offloading system take dynamic features such as data transfer size or
network conditions into account to make offloading decisions, it is
impractical for these approaches to build a globally well-defined
offloading decision policy while considering all possible cases against
dynamic mobile environments.
%
Furthermore, it is difficult to generalize the above efforts for various
mobile application use case scenario, since different applications need
to have different offloading decision policies due to different
application requirements or characteristics.
%
Therefore, in practice, it is necessary for the scheduler to learn
from self-observation of the previous decision correctness and to
dynamically adapt the decision policy on runtime, thereby an identical
decision model can be \textit{generally} applied to various mobile
applications without any predefined decision policies.\\
%
\indent In this paper, we aim to develop a general framework for a
runtime adaptive scheduler for mobile offloading framework by
employing various types of machine learning techniques.
%
By applying machine learning techniques to scheduling problems
for mobile offloading framework, the machine learning classifier can
make decisions on whether mobile computations should be offloaded to
external resources or executed locally.
%
To this end, we modularized our previous work on the machine
learning-based runtime scheduler~\cite{ml} in which any appropriate
machine learning classifiers can be utilized for the runtime scheduler
for mobile offloading framework.
%
This work can be plugged and played with any types of mobile offloading
frameworks in conjunction with the well-defined APIs to monitor and
acquire dynamic features such as data size, network conditions, or the
status of external devices. 
%
Furthermore, our work supports an online training mechanism for
the machine learning-based runtime scheduler such that it learns from
observation on the previous offloading decision performance, and
dynamically adapts its decision policy on runtime.\\
%
\indent As part of the modularization effort, we integrated the
modules of the machine learning-based runtime scheduler into the Java-based
offloading-capable mobile applications which are automatically
refactored by a novel tool, called \textit{DPartner}.
%
Originally, the offloading-capable mobile applications regenerated by
DPartner depend on the web-based user interface to offload or execute
the offloadable computations (i.e. classes) in local, so the user
schedules them manually by manipulating the user interface in a
drag-and-drop way.
%
By combining the machine learning-based runtime scheduler with these
applications, the user can be free of the burden of the scheduling
tasks.
%
Based on this integration, we evaluated the cost and performance for
three machine learning algorithms, instance based learning, perceptron,
and na\"{i}ve bayes with respect to classifier training time,
classification time, and scheduling accuracy.
%
Even though there have been prior related studies which suggest
utilizing machine learning techniques for mobile computing environments,
to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to consider the
online training mechanism for the machine learning-based runtime
scheduler for mobile offloading framework and demonstrate the
performance and cost of various machine learning algorithms for the use
of the runtime scheduler of mobile offloading framework.\\   
%
\indent The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
%
In Section II, we overview prior research efforts on offloading decision
problems in mobile offloading framework as well as the use of machine
learning techniques for scheduling problems from various domains.
%
Section III summarizes our previous work which proposed the machine
learning based runtime scheduler for mobile offloading framework.
%
Section IV motives the concept of the online machine learning-based
runtime scheduler.
%
In Section IV and V, we explain and evaluate our implementation of the
online ML scheduler.
%
Also, Section VI describes the current and potential applications for
our work.
%
Finally, we conclude the paper in Section VII.
%
\section{Related Works}
%
\section{Runtime Scheduler for Mobile Offloading System}
%
In this section, we summarize our previous work on the machine
learning-based runtime scheduler for mobile offloading framework.
%
In our previous work, we noticed the offloading performance dependency on
various dynamic features such as data size and network conditions.
%
Then, we suggested applying machine learning techniques to the runtime
scheduler for mobile offloading framework by showing the performance and
cost among various machine learning algorithms. 
% 
\subsection{Offloading Performance}
%
In our previous work~\cite{ml}, we validated the necessity and efficacy
of the runtime scheduler for mobile offloading framework through
detailed measurement experiments.
%
With the OpenCL-based mobile offloading framework~\cite{ocloff}, we
performed various experiments using four different OpenCL workload
kernels used in a variety of areas such as image processing filters and
mathematical simulations.
%
Also, in order to observe the impact of different network conditions on
the offoading performance, we configured different network conditions:
local area network, campus network, and wide area network (i.e. Amazon
EC2 cloud).
%
In the evaluation, we verified that different network conditions cause
significantly different offloading performance.
%
In most cases, offloading to the remote resource located in local area
network has better performance than local processing in four OpenCL
workload kernels used for the experiments.
%
In contrast, offloading to the remote resource located in campus network
and Amazon EC2 cloud, where have much limited network conditions than
local area network, can exhibit longer execution time than local
processing according to the size of data transfer.\\ 
%
\indent It is worth noting that each OpenCL workload kernel shows
the different performance, even though they process the similar size of
data.
%
This is because each kernel has different computational complexities so
they gain the different amount of performance improvement while paying
the same cost to send the data to the remote resource.
%
These results show that there exists the offloading performance
variation over different network conditions and OpenCL workload kernels.
%
Consequently, proper scheduling can have a significant impact on the
offloading performance and mobile offloading framework requires the
support from the runtime scheduler.
%
\subsection{Machine Learning-based Runtime Scheduler}
%
Based on our observation, we applied machine learning techniques to the
runtime scheduling problem for mobile offloading framework.
%
For doing this, we first chose a set of relevant attributes which have
an impact on making offloading decisions.
%
Also, by running the OpenCL-based offloading framework with different
network configurations, OpenCL workload kernels, and data size, we
collected a total 640 data instances to train and test the classifiers
of various machine learning algorithms.
%
Using the gathered dataset, we trained various machine learning
classifiers with \textit{Weka}, a Java-based open source package for
machine learning techniques.
%
Finally, we implemented the machine learning-based runtime scheduler by
building the trained machine learning classifiers onto the
OpenCL-based mobile offloading system.\\
%
\indent In order to evaluate the machine learning-based runtime
scheduler for mobile offloading framework, we deployed the OpenCL-based
offloading system under various network bandwidth controlled by a
network characteristic tool called \textit{Traffic Control} (TC).
%
In our evaluation, we observed that most of the machine learning-based
schedulers show the reasonably high scheduling performance by achieving
higher than 80\% of the scheduling accuracy.
%
Especially, Instance-Based Learning has the most accurate scheduling
performance among various schedulers showing 92\% of the scheduling
accuracy.
%
Compared with other machine learning-based schedulers, furthermore,
Instance-Based Learning exhibits a fairly small penalty, which is the
additional cost in terms of the execution time and energy consumption
when the scheduler makes incorrect decisions.
%
\section{Challenge on Online Training for Machine Learning-based Mobile
Offloading Scheduler}
%
The main goal in this work is to construct the machine learning-based
runtime scheduler with online training for mobile offloading framework.
%
In this section, we explain the difference between offline and online
training for the machine learning technique.
%
Also, we describe the challenge on the online training mechanism for the
machine learning-based runtime scheduler.
%
\subsection{Offline vs. Online Training}
%
Machine learning technique is a branch of artificial intelligence
through which a system can learn from previous experiences proactively
and predict the future actions of the target system.
%
In fact, there exist two possible ways to train the machine learning
classifier: \textit{offline} and \textit{online} training.
%
In offline training, the machine learning classifier can be trained
using a set of the pre-collected static data.
%
Once the machine learning classifier is trained in the initial training
phase, the classifier does not change its prediction behavior.
%
It is therefore difficult to reflect the unseen situations or conditions
which have not been trained in the initial training phase.
%
For that reason, offline machine learning is trained through a large set
of data which covers as many cases as possible in order to accomplish
the high prediction performance.\\
%
\indent On the other hand, the online machine learning technique does
not depend on any pre-trained classifiers to approximate or predict 
the future behaviors of the target system.
%
Instead, online machine learning trains its classifier at a time
when a new data instance arrives in.
%
More specifically, the classifier of online machine learning is trained
whenever the result of the comparison between the prediction and actual
behavior is available.
%
Thus, the main challenge of online machine learning is to deliver the
prediction correctness into the training process, so that it can train
the classifier continuously based on the prediction correctness feedback.
%
\subsection{Requirement for Online Training Machine Learning-based
Mobile Offloading Scheduler}
%
As mentioned in the previous subsection, the online training mechanism has
to maintain its own continuous feedback channel from the examination of
whether the prediction made by the classifier is correct, and if not,
which prediction should have made in the case where multiple predictions
are available.  
%
However, it can be too expensive to feedback with the correct
prediction, since the system may have to try all of the possible cases
to figure out the correct prediction.\\
%
\indent In the case for the mobile offloading scheduler, even though
there exist only two possible cases: offloading and local processing,
the mobile platform also has to pay for both offloading and local
processing.  
%
It is therefore required to minimize the online training phase while
guaranteeing the reasonable scheduling accuracy.
%
In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing the adaptive
online training mechanism in which the training phase stretches and
shrinks dynamically according to the scheduling accuracy. 
%
\section{Architecture of Machine Learning-based Runtime Scheduler with
Online Training}
%
In this section, we describe the architecture and main modules of the
machine learning-based mobile offloading scheduler with online training.
%
Then, we give the implementation details on the adaptive online training
mechanism.
%
Finally, we explain how the proposed machine learning-based mobile
offloading scheduler can be integrated with mobile offloading framework.
%
The overall architecture and main modules of the machine learning-based
mobile offloading scheduler with online training are illustrated in
Figure 1.
%
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[height=5.1cm, width=7.6cm]{Figure/figure1}
\caption{Overall architecture of the ML-based mobile offloading
scheduler with online training. The dotted lines indicate the
application and network features flow path, and the solid lines are the
application workloads or scheduling-related commands flow path.}
\end{figure}
%
\subsection{Architecture of the Machine Learning-based Mobile Offloading
Scheduler}
%
As depicted in Figure 1, the overall architecture of the machine
learning-based mobile offloading scheduler with online training consists
of four main modules: computation router, runtime scheduler, machine
learning classifier, and machine learning classifier trainer.
%
These four main modules interact with each other to execute and
schedule the mobile computing task, and train the machine learning
classifier while switching two different phases: \textit{normal
operation phase} and \textit{online training phase}.
%
In the normal operation phase, when the computation router receives the
offloadable computations (\textcircled{1}), according to the scheduling
status (\textcircled{2}), it routes these computations to the
appropriate execution unit, local computing units or network interface
(\textcircled{3}). 
%
On the other hand, in the online training phase, the offloadble
computations are forwarded to both execution units, and the computation
router feedbacks the performance comparison between offloading and local
processing (\textcircled{4}).
%
Based on the feedback from the router, classifer trainer updates the
machine learning classifier{\textcircled{5}).
%
The implementation details for main modules are as follows: \\
%
\textbf{Computation router.} The computation router has the
responsibility to forward the offloadable mobile computations either to the
network interface (for offloading) or to the local computing units (for
local processing) according to the scheduling status of each offloadable
computation which is stored in scheduling table.
%
Also, the router keeps the feedback channel with the classifier updater
in the machine learning classifier trainer module, so that it provides
the performance comparison between offloading and local processing 
the offloading and local processing performance.\\
%
\textbf{Runtime scheduler.} Since scheduling mobile computations
requires to profile internal and external dynamic features which are
used for machine learning attributes such as data size and network
conditions on runtime, the scheduling process results in the additional
costs in terms of the runtime overhead and energy consumption.
%
Thus, there exists the trade-off between the scheduling performance and
cost, as coarse-grained scheduling is much cheaper than frequent
scheduling, but it leads worse scheduling accuracy.    
%
For this reason, we consider two scheduling strategies.
%
First strategy reschedules the mobile computations whenever the
application executes these mobile computations.
%
We refer this strategy to the \textit{on-demand scheduling}.
%
Another strategy is the \textit{periodic scheduling} in which the mobile
offloadable computations are rescheduled asynchronously with the adaptive
scheduling interval.
%
In the periodic scheduling strategy, in other words, scheduling the mobile
computations is done with the specific interval regardless of the
invocations of the mobile computations from the application.
%
However, in order to prevent unnecessarily too frequent scheduling, the
scheduling interval controller changes the scheduling interval according
to network conditions such that the interval becomes shorter if the
variation of network bandwidth is less than a certain threshold.
%
Otherwise, the scheduling frequency leaves in a long interval mode.
%
To end this, the scheduling interval controller stores previous
\textit{N} network bandwidth measurement histories.\\
%
\textbf{Machine learning classifier.} The machine learning classifier is
in charge of making decisions on offloading or local processing for the
offloadable mobile computations by using the attributes obtained by
the network and application profiler.
%
Even though it is possible to adopt various attributes to capture the
present scheduling problem from internal and external environments, for
the current implementation, we utilized two attributes: the size of data
to be sent to the remote resource and network bandwidth.
%
It is also worth noting that, in the periodic scheduling mode, the
real-time measurement of the data size of the mobile computations is
unfeasible because the scheduling process is triggered periodically, but
asynchronously regardless of the invocations of the mobile computations.
%
In the periodic scheduling mode, instead, the application profiler
calculates the mean and standard deviation of the previous measurements
to anticipate the maximum and minimum possible data size.
%
Then, the machine learning classifier makes the decision on offloading
only when both classifications with the maximum and minimum possible
data size agree on offloading.\\
%
\textbf{Machine learning classifier trainer.} With the feedback on the
performance comparison between offloading and local processing from the
computation router, the machine learning classifier trainer updates
the machine learning classifier.
%
In order to compare the performance between offloading and local
processing, the trainer creates one separate thread for local
processing, so that offloading and local processing can be executed
simultaneously.
%
Then the computation router measures the execution time for both
offloading and local processing to compare the performance and provide
the feedback into the classifier updater.
%
Finally, with this feedback from the computation router and the
attributes from the profilers, the classifier updater trains the
classifier.
%
\subsection{Adaptive Online Training Mechanism}
%
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=3.3cm, width=8.5cm]{Figure/figure2}
\caption{An example of the adaptive online training mechanism. For this
example, we set 70\% of the scheduling accuracy threshold and 5 of the
minimum number of the mobile computation executions.}
\end{figure}
%
One of important contributions of this work is the adaptive online
training mechanism in which the training phase stretches and shrinks
according to the scheduling performance (i.e. scheduling accuracy).
%
Figure 2 illustrate the example of how the adaptive online training
mechanism.
%
In this example, we set the minimum number of the executions of the
mobile computations in one period to 5.
%
First of all, the training phase (empty bars) in a period
continues until the scheduling accuracy is higher than a certain
threshold.
%
In order to avoid 100\% of the scheduling accuracy at just one training,
we insert a dummy training which does nothing with the training process,
but indicates an incorrect decision. 
%
By adding this dummy training into the measurement of the scheduling
accuracy, more than one training in a period can be guaranteed.\\
%
\indent Once the training phase finishes, the normal operation phase
follows by starting the scheduling process until the period is
completed.
%
Since we set 70\% of the accuracy threshold for this example and no
decision error happened in the first and second period, the machine
learning can be trained for first three of executions and the rest of
the executions (two for the first period and seven for the second
period) are done in the normal operation phase. 
%
Furthermore, because there was no decision error in the first and second
period, the next number of the executions of the mobile computation
increases by 5 which is the minimum number of the executions in a
period, thus, the number of the computation executions for the second
and third period becomes 10 and 15, respectively.
%
In the second period, however, as one incorrect decision has been
occurred, the training phase holds for six executions when the
scheduling accuracy becomes higher than 70\%, and the number of the
executions in the fourth period decreases by 5 which is the minimum
number of the executions in a period multiplied by the number of the
occurred errors (in this case, 1). 
%
The pseudo-code of the adaptive online training mechanism is shown in
Figure 3.

\end{algorithmic}

%
\subsection{Integration with On-Demand Java-based Offloading Framework}
%
As part of the modularization effort, we integrated the modules of the
machine learning-based mobile offloading scheduler into the Java-based
offloading-capable mobile applications which are automatically
refactored by a novel tool, called DPartner.
%
Given an Android mobile application, first of all, DPartner examines its
bytecode to classify the Java classes into the anchored and offloadable
classes, so it can be guaranteed that the anchored classes are executed
on the mobile device while directly using a variety of the local sensors
such as the GUI display, camera, accelerator, and GPS.
%
Also, DPartner rewrites the bytecode for the offloadable classes to
implement a special type of the program structure to support on-demand
offloading.
%
Then, DPartner packages the files such as images, xml files, external
libraries, and rewritten bytecode for the offoadable classes, and
generate two separate objects which are deployed into the mobile device
and the remote server, respectively.\\
%
\indent For the scheduling challenge, however, the offloading-capable
Android applications generated by DPartner relies upon the third party
unit which is the web-based user interface named RuntimeManager, so the
individual user should schedule the offloadable classes manually by
controlling the user interface in a drag-and-drop way. 
%
Though, for the real use case scenario, it is impractical that the
mobile user monitors the internal and external environments and
schedules each offloadable mobile computations on runtime.
%
For that reason, we address this challenge by integrating the modules of
the machine learning-based runtime scheduler with the on-demand
Java-based offloading framework.  
%
By combining the machine learning-based runtime scheduler with these
applications, the mobile user can be free of the burden of the scheduling
tasks.
%
\section{Evaluation}
%
In this section, we evaluate the implementation of the machine
learning-based mobile offloading scheduler with online training with
respect to the scheduling accuracy and classifier training cost.
%
In order to compare the performance and cost among the different
categories of machine learning algorithms, we utilize three machine
learning algorithms: instance-based learning, single layer perceptron,
and na\"{i}ve bayes.
%

\subfigure[Scheduling accuracy] {
\includegraphics[height=4.0cm, width=5.6cm]{Figure/figure6}
}
\caption{Performance and cost comparison for three machine learning
algorithms}
\end{figure*}
%
\subsection{Experimental Setup}
%
Even though high dimensional machine learning algorithms such as
decision tree, multilayer perceptron, and support vector machine can
achieve more accurate scheduling performance, they might be too
expensive to be used for the mobile offloading scheduler.
%
Based on the intuitive observation on the algorithm complexity, we
selected three machine learning algorithms: instance-based learning,
single layer perceptron, and na\"{i}ve bayes.\\ 
%
\indent Our hardware setup consists of the mobile client and
remote server which are connected through a wireless router.
%
We have utilized Android tabletPC, Nexus 5 equipped with 2.3GHz
quad-core processor and 2GB RAM, and running Android KitKat as the
mobile client.
%
For the remote server, we used a workstation with Intel 3.0GHz Core2 Duo
processor and 8GB memory which is running Linux OS.
%
In order to emulate various network conditions, furthermore, we
configured different network bandwidth using Traffic Control
(TC)~\cite{tc}, a network tool which provides functionality to control
network traffic by priortizing network resources and using concepts of
traffic classification, queue disciplines, and quality of service.
%
Also, for the mobile application used in the evaluation, we created
a synthetic benchmark application, matrix multiplication, and DPartner
rewrote it as the offloading-capable application.
%
Though, theoretically, DPartner is applicable to any types of Android
mobile applications, it is not possible to intentionally change the data
size and the amount of computation for the real-world applications.
%
With matrix multiplication, we are able to easily vary the data size and
the amount of computation by manually controlling the matrix size.
%
\subsection{Overhead of training and classification}
%
Since our machine learning-based mobile offloading scheduler keeps
training the classifier, which leads some runtime overhead, we
observed the cost to train the machine learning classifier.
%
As shown in Figure 4(a), instance-based learning has the shortes
classifier training time among three machine learning algorithms.  
%
In fact, the basis for the classification of instance-based learning is
the instance database, where previously experienced cases are stored.
%
Instead of training the explicit classifier, therefore, instance-based
learning adds a new instance to the database for the future
classification raising relatively small training overhead.
%
On the other hand, na\"{i}ve bayes with 1000 instances of database has
the worst training overhead. 
%
For the algorithm perspective, na\"{i}ve bayes measures the
probability density for the given classes with the mean and standard
deviation, and chooses the class with the highest probability.
the highest probability.
%
Thus na\"{i}ve bayes calculates the mean and standard deviation
throughout the previous instances for each class whenever a new instance
is trained.
%
Consequently, na\"{i}ve bayes with 1000 instancs, which requires
relatively heavy calculations for the mean and standard deviation, has
bigger training overhead than other machine learning algorithms.\\
%
\indent Also, Figure 4(b) shows the classification time that the machine
learning classifier consumes to make a decision.
%
Similarly as the training time, na\"{i}ve bayes shows bigger overhead
than other machine learing algorithms.
%
In fact, we used the Gaussian distribution to calculate the probability
density for each class with the mean and standard deviation value.
%
Therefore, the classification for na\"{i}ve bayes entails the complex
arithmetic operations such as the exponential function and the square root
which take longer than addition, multiplication, or comparison.
%
For that reason, na\"{i}ve bayes has the worst classification overhead.
%
Note that perceptron has remarkably low classification overhead compared
with other machine learning algorithms. 
%
For perceptron, the classification process involves calculating the
output from a multivariable linear equation consisting of the attributes
weighted by the coefficients, which requires the insignificant amount of
the computation. 
%
As a result, perceptron shows the lowest cost in terms of the
classification time amongst three machine learning algorithms.
%
\subsection{Scheduling Accuracy}
%
We also investigated the scheduling accuracy of three machine learning
algorithms.
%
For the unbiased evaluation, we turned off the adaptive online training
mechanism and the training phase and normal operation phase were
uniformly switched in one period (5 trainings and 15 normal operations)
and 10 periods were repeated for the average.
%
Also, in order to observe the impact of the dynamic network condition
and data size on the scheduling accuracy, we changed the network
bandwidth randomly among 1MB/s, 2.5MB/s, 5MB/s, and 9.5MB/s with
a same interval and each computation processes the different matrix size
having the different data size. 
%
In this experimental setup, we observed how accurate each machine
learning makes decisions in the normal operation phase.\\
%
\indent As you can see in Figure 4(c), instance-based learning achieves
the highest scheduling performance, showing 87\% of the scheduling
accuracy.  
%
As we mentioned earlier, instance-based learning compares a new
scheduling problem with the all of the stored instances in the database
to find out the most similar case in the database.
%
It is because that instance-based learning can hardly miss any
information from the previously stored instances.
%
On the other hand, na\"{i}ve bayes has the worst scheduling accuracy
which is lower than 80\% of the accuracy.
%
The reason is that the classification of the probabilistic machine
learning algorithms is based on the statistics of attibutes of the
previous instances such as the mean and standard deviation.
%
Thus it is possible that the probability-based machine learning
algorithms can overlook the edge of previously seen instances, which
causes the performance degradation for the prediction problem.
%
\section{Use Case}
%
We applied our machine learning-based mobile offloading scheduler with
online training to Go, the two players board game which is available in
Google Play.
%
In Go game shown in Figure 5, the next stone position of the competitor
is calculated through the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm, thus the
offloading-capable version of the Go game offloads the Monte Carlo
algorithm to the remote server according to the board size and network
bandwidth.
%
Also, for Go game, the quick reactivity from the competitor is one of
the important aspects to play the game seamlessly.
%
So, the on-demand scheduling strategy can cause relatively high overhead
by doing the scheduling process for every competitor turn.
%
For that reason, we utilized the periodic scheduling strategy for Go
game.\\
%
\indent Another possible application is the optical character
recognition (OCR) application with the translation between different
languages.
%
Character recognition and language traslation technologies include
the complex mechanisms such as pattern recognition and data mining which
are suitable for offloading.
%
Hence, the flexibility of where to execute these complex algorithms
according to the image size and network conditions will help the mobile
device improve the performance and save energy consumption.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
%
In this paper, we proposed the machine learning-based mobile offloading
scheduler with the online training mechanism.
%
First, we modularized the machine learning-based mobile offloading
scheduler to generally apply to any types of mobile offloading
frameworks.
%
Also, we suggested the adaptive online training mechanism in which the
training phase and normal operation phase are dynamically switched
according to the scheduling accuracy.
%
To evaluate our work, we applied the machine learning-based mobile
offloading scheduler with online training to the Java-based on-demand
offloading framework.
%
Also, we utilized three different machine learning algorithms for the
offloading scheduler and compared the overhead and performance in terms
of the training time, classification time, and scheduling accuracy.
%
In the evaluation, we observed that instance-based leaning and na\"{i}ve
bayes have higher than 80\% of the scheduling accuracy with the
reasonable overhead.\\
%
\indent For the future work, we plan to apply our work to various types
of mobile offloading frameworks with more machine learning algorithms
and target real-world applications.
